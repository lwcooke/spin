# spin
Simulations of spin systems with QuTiP, mainly for my research

# Requirements

* `numpy` obviously, it's scientific computing in python after all! ([conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numpy))
* `qutip` the main package for these simulations ([conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qutip))
* `matplotlib` for plotting results ([conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib))
